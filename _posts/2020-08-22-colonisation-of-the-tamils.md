description: Colonisation of the Tamils, and its deniers and apologists.
---

I'm a Tamil, tracing my ancestry to the ancient *[tamiṛakam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamilakam)*. My people, the Tamils, have travelled widely over millennia for trade and profit. They have also waged war against neighbouring lands and colonised other realms. But this is about my people being colonised by other peoples.

Today, there are groups that make a stand against the different waves of colonisation. Yet, these same groups often gloss over other waves of colonisation: they deny their existence, they deny their effects, and they claim the good effects outweigh the bad. Below is a summary:

| Colonisers | Timeline | Effects | Deniers & Apologists |
|-|-|-|
| The English and other Europeans | 15th–19th c. CE | English fluency, wealth loss, native language disfluency | Westernised urban‐dwellers [^English1] [^English2] |
| The Mughals and other Turkic peoples | 14th–18th c. CE | Persian flavours, wheat, Persian attire | Dravidian movement, the left‐wing [^Mughal1] |
| The Aryans | 2000 BCE–present | Rice, loss of millets, eradication of native religions, syncretism with Dharmic religions, Hindustani cultural hegemony | Upper‐caste Hindus [^Aryan1] [^Aryan2] [^Aryan3] |
