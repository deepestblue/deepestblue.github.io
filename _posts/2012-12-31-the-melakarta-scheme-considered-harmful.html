<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><h3>What is the <em>mēḷakartā</em> scheme?</h3><div>Classical music is defined by its usage of <em>rāga</em>s. Each <em>rāga</em> can invoke specific emotions in <em>rasika</em>s, and each <em>rasika</em> will have their set of favourite (and disliked) <em>rāga</em>s. While music comprises <em>kalpitasaṅgīta</em> and <em>manōdharmasaṅgīta</em>, both aspects adhere to the underlying <em>rāga</em><em>lakṣaṇa</em>. With few exceptions, each piece is composed in one prescribed <em>rāga</em>, and that <em>rāga</em> constrains both <em>kalpitasaṅgīta</em> and <em>manōdharmasaṅgīta</em> in that piece. Transgressing the boundaries of a <em>rāga</em> by mistake is an egregious error, and such an <em>apasvara</em> would be spotted immediately by many <em>rasika</em>s.<br /><br />Much music theory is devoted to classifying these <em>rāga</em>s. The predominant scheme used to today is the <em>mēḷakartā</em> scheme, involving 72 <em>mēḷakartā</em>, or <em>janaka</em> <em>rāga</em>s, and all other <em>janya</em> <em>rāga</em>s classified under them. Ramamatya (c.1550 CE), in his <em>svaramēḷakalānidhi</em>, proposed a <em>mēḷam</em>-based scheme, which Venkatamakhin (17th c. CE) extended into a <em>mēḷakartā</em> scheme in his <em>chaturdaṇḍiprakāśikā</em>. The scheme followed today is a standardised variant proposed by Govindacharya (17th-18th c. CE), in his <em>saṅgrahacūḍāmaṇi</em>.</div><h3>How does it work?</h3><div>12 <em>svarasthāna</em>s are enumerated, from the base <em>ṣadja</em> to the <em>ṣadja</em> of the next octave (left-inclusive), and are given the following names, picked from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svara">an earlier nomenclature</a>.<br /><ol><li>Sa</li><li>Ri<sub>1</sub></li><li>Ri<sub>2</sub>/Ga<sub>1</sub></li><li>Ri<sub>3</sub>/Ga<sub>2</sub></li><li>Ga<sub>3</sub></li><li>Ma<sub>1</sub></li><li>Ma<sub>2</sub></li><li>Pa</li><li>Da<sub>1</sub></li><li>Da<sub>2</sub>/Ni<sub>1</sub></li><li>Da<sub>3</sub>/Ni<sub>2</sub></li><li>Ni<sub>3</sub></li></ol>The <em>mēḷakartā</em>s, then, are all the possible <em>rāga</em>s that include the <em>Sa</em> &amp; <em>Pa</em>, and have one each <em>Ri</em>, <em>Ga</em>, <em>Ma</em>, <em>Da</em> &amp; <em>Ni</em>, with the obvious restriction that the <em>Ga</em> chosen should be higher than the <em>Ri</em>, and likewise the <em>Da</em> and the <em>Ni</em>. There are 6 possible <em>Ri-Ga</em> combinations (Ri<sub>1</sub>Ga<sub>1</sub>, Ri<sub>1</sub>Ga<sub>2</sub>, Ri<sub>1</sub>Ga<sub>3</sub>, Ri<sub>2</sub>Ga<sub>2</sub>, Ri<sub>2</sub>Ga<sub>3</sub> &amp; Ri<sub>3</sub>Ga<sub>3</sub>), likewise 6 combinations of <em>Da-Ni</em>, and 2 options for <em>Ma</em>. There are thus 72 <em>mēḷakartā</em>s, also termed <em>sampūrna</em> as each has all 7 notes.<br /><br />Every other <em>rāga</em>, which may not adhere to the above <em>lakṣaṇa</em>, is then notated as a pair of scales of the above notes – an <em>ārōhaṇa</em> and an <em>avarōhaṇa</em> – that define them. The <em>ārōhaṇa</em> is a scale that starts at a lower <em>Sa</em> and ends at the next <em>Sa</em> and is meant to be a union of all possible ascending sequences of notes valid in the <em>rāga</em>. Likewise, the <em>avarōhaṇa</em>, starting at a higher <em>Sa</em> and ending at the previous <em>Sa</em> is meant to combine all possible valid descending note sequences. The <em>janya</em> <em>rāga</em> is then classified "under" the <em>mēḷakartā</em> rāga.<br /><br />e.g. Arabhi is considered to be the scale SaRi<sub>2</sub>Ma<sub>1</sub>PaDa<sub>2</sub>Sa/SaNi<sub>3</sub>Da<sub>2</sub>PaMa<sub>1</sub>Ga<sub>3</sub>Ri<sub>2</sub>Sa, and is thus classified under <em>mēḷakartā</em> SaRi<sub>2</sub>Ga<sub>3</sub>Ma<sub>1</sub>PaDa<sub>2</sub>Ni<sub>3</sub>Sa/SaNi<sub>3</sub>Da<sub>2</sub>PaMa<sub>1</sub>Ga<sub>3</sub>Ri<sub>2</sub>Sa, which happens to be Sankarabharanam. Purvikalyani, which is assigned the scale SaRi<sub>1</sub>Ga<sub>3</sub>Ma<sub>2</sub>PaDa<sub>2</sub>PaSa/SaNi<sub>3</sub>Da<sub>2</sub>PaMa<sub>2</sub>Ga<sub>3</sub>Ri<sub>1</sub>Sa, is considered a derivative of <em>mēḷakartā</em> SaRi<sub>1</sub>Ga<sub>3</sub>Ma<sub>2</sub>PaDa<sub>2</sub>Ni<sub>3</sub>Sa/SaNi<sub>3</sub>Da<sub>2</sub>PaMa<sub>2</sub>Ga<sub>3</sub>Ri<sub>1</sub>Sa or Gamanasramam. Bhairavi, nominally the scale SaGa<sub>2</sub>Ri<sub>2</sub>Ga<sub>2</sub>Ma<sub>1</sub>PaDa<sub>2</sub>Ni<sub>3</sub>Sa/SaNi<sub>3</sub>Da<sub>1</sub>PaMa<sub>1</sub>Ga<sub>2</sub>Ri<sub>2</sub>Sa (note the 2 different <em>Ga</em>s), is classified under SaRi<sub>2</sub>Ga<sub>2</sub>Ma<sub>1</sub>PaDa<sub>1</sub>Ni<sub>3</sub>Sa/SaNi<sub>3</sub>Da<sub>1</sub>PaMa<sub>1</sub>Ga<sub>2</sub>Ri<sub>2</sub>Sa, Natabhairavi, with the Da<sub>2</sub> considered an <em>anyasvara</em>.</div><h3>How is it used?</h3><div>In pedagogy and in musicology, a <em>rāga</em> is introduced as a child of a <em>mēḷakartā</em> and then in terms of its <em>ārōhaṇa</em> and <em>avarōhaṇa</em>. An excerpt from <a href="http://www.karnatik.com/c2577.shtml">a song-lyric page</a> follows:</div><blockquote class="tr_bq">raagam: bEgaDa<br />29 dheera shankaraabharaNam janya<br />Aa: S G3 R2 G3 M1 P D2 N2 D2 P S<br />Av: S N3 D2 P M1 G3 R2 S</blockquote><div><em>Rasika</em>s "in the know" seek to learn which <em>mēḷakartā</em> a <em>rāga</em> belongs to, and attempt to understand the <em>rāga</em> based on this scheme. Unfortunately, the entire exercise is pointless.</div><h3>So why do you say it is useless?</h3><div>Inherently, what defines a <em>rāga</em> is not the set of notes but the phrases. The notes used to describe the phrases, let alone the <em>ārōhaṇa</em>/<em>avarōhaṇa</em>, are but notational conveniences. Notice for instance, that Atana is notated with a <em>Ga</em>, but the <em>Ga</em> sung in Atana is but an oscillation between Ri<sub>2</sub> and Ma<sub>1</sub>. Likewise in Darbar, where it's a different oscillation, also between Ri<sub>2</sub> and Ma<sub>1</sub>. The PaDa<sub>2</sub>Sa phrases from Suddhasaveri or Yadukulakambhoji are identical to the PaNi<sub>2</sub>Sa phrases from Madhyamavati or Dhanyasi. A classic phrase from Anandabhairavi can be annotated as both PaDa<sub>2</sub>PaSa or PaNi<sub>2</sub>PaSa.<br /><br />The result is a huge disconnect between many classic <em>janya</em> <em>rāga</em>s and their nominal parents. None of Sahana, Khamas, Kambhoji, Natakurinji, Suratti and Mohanam have anything to do with any other, save for the fact that they are classified under Harikambhoji. Likewise, Reetigaula, Bhairavi, Darbarikanada, Hindolam, Suddhadhanyasi are all classified under Natabhairavi, albeit none of them sound like any other. So what use is such a system that emphasises the names of the notes?<br /><br />To quote musicologist Dr. N Ramanathan, "People exclaim <em>Gajavadana</em>, set in <em>Todi</em>, has so many different kinds of <em>Ga'</em>s; that's not the case. How remarkable that various different phrases are all termed <em>Ga</em>! We use a single symbol <em>Ga</em> to identify many of the phrases. … That, I feel, is a very sophisticated (scheme) which in the 1800s or 1700s we (Carnatic music practitioners) have developed. … The word <em>svara</em> itself is redefined. <em>Svara</em> is no longer associated with a pitch – <em>svara</em> is a phrase. We say that Sankarabharanam has 4 kinds of <em>Ma'</em>s; Begada has 3 kinds of <em>Ma</em>'s. No, we term all those phrases <em>Ma</em>."<br /><br />Any system that emphasises notational conveniences at the expense of the <em>lakṣaṇa</em> of the <em>rāga</em> is missing the point.</div><h3>But is there anything inherently wrong with the scheme?</h3><div><em>rāga</em>s inherently are not a taxonomy, and trying to fit them into a tree-structure is futile. There are undoubtedly relationships among <em>rāga</em>s: Mukhari, Bhairavi, Huseni and Manji have many common <em>prayōga</em>s. Mukhari though, is related to Suddhamukhari historically, and through it to Kanakambari and Kanakangi. People think Huseni sounds somewhat like Anandabhairavi, which is classified under Kharaharapriya in the <em>mēḷakartā</em>-scheme. Already our taxon is a little unwieldy. <br /><br />The <em>janya</em> <em>rāga</em> examples above – Arabhi, Purvikalyani, Bhairavi – happen to contain all the <em>saptasvara</em>s. What if the <em>rāga</em> does not? There would be multiple <em>mēḷakartā</em> super-sets of this <em>rāga</em>, so which one do you pick as parent? There are 2 systems in usage: <br /><ul><li>Pick the earlier one: if the <em>janya</em> <em>rāga</em> does not contain <em>Ri</em>, then pick the <em>mēḷakartā</em> with Ri<sub>1</sub> rather than Ri<sub>2</sub> or Ri<sub>3</sub>. This arbitrary choice only helps derail the already tenuous <em>janaka</em>-<em>janya</em> relationship.</li><li>Pick the <em>mēḷakartā</em> that sounds closest. This choice is also arbitrary, as many <em>janya</em>-<em>rāga</em>s don't sound like any of the candidate parent <em>mēḷakartā</em> <em>rāga</em>s. Madhyamavati can be assigned to Natabhairavi, Kharaharapriya, Charukesi or Harikambhoji on this basis, but sounds like none of them.</li></ul><div>Many <em>rāga</em>s, not amenable to being described as a linear progession of notes, are strait-jacketed when fit into an <em>ārōhaṇa</em>/<em>avarōhaṇa</em> scheme. Atana, Suratti, Sindhubhairavi, Purvikalyani, Bhairavi, Kambhoji all include phrases that cannot be fit into a linear scale. Atana &amp; Suratti are especially problematic: no <em>ārōhaṇa</em>/<em>avarōhaṇa</em> written for them cover even a portion of the phrases possible. Finding a <em>mēḷakartā</em> parent is thus futile.<br /><br /></div><div>Lastly, <em>bhāṣāṅgarāga</em>s exhibit different problems of classification, as its sometimes unclear which <em>svara</em>s belong in the scale and which are <em>anyasvara</em>s. Kapi, Sindhubhairavi and Brindavani exemplify this problem.</div></div><h3>And why is it harmful?</h3><div>Generations of students has grown up focussing on learning the wrong bases of <em>rāga</em>s, the foundation of music. Generations of <em>rasika</em>s has been cheated out of appreciating the grain of <em>rāgabhāva</em>, by concentrating on the chaff of <em>mēḷakartā</em>s. Years of cross-cultural understanding of South Indian classical music by world audiences have been lost on account of trying to marry Indian music ideas to European music concepts of pitches, notes and scales.</div><h3>OK. What instead?</h3><div>Pedagogy must focus on learning <em>rāgabhāva</em> through <em>saṅgati</em>s and <em>lakṣaṇa</em> without focussing on <em>ārōhaṇa</em>/<em>avarōhaṇa</em>. And <em>rasika</em>s should be steered clear of trying to enjoy a <em>rāga</em> through learning scales.</div><h3>Glossary</h3><table>    <tbody><tr>        <th align="left">Term</th>        <th align="left">Meaning</th>    </tr><tr>        <td><em>anyasvara</em></td>        <td>Exceptional <em>svara</em>, absent in the parent <em>mēḷakartā</em></td>    </tr><tr>        <td><em>apasvara</em></td>        <td>Grave <em>svara</em> error</td>    </tr><tr>        <td><em>ārōhaṇa</em></td>        <td>Ascending scale</td>    </tr><tr>        <td><em>avarōhaṇa</em></td>        <td>Descending scale</td>    </tr><tr>        <td><em>bhāṣāṅgarāga</em></td>        <td><em>Rāga</em>s with one ore more <em>anyasvara</em>s</td>    </tr><tr>        <td><em>bhāva</em></td>        <td>Emotion</td>    </tr><tr>        <td><em>janaka</em></td>        <td>Parent</td>    </tr><tr>        <td><em>janya</em></td>        <td>Child</td>    </tr><tr>        <td><em>kalpitasaṅgīta</em></td>        <td>Precomposed music</td>    </tr><tr>        <td><em>lakṣaṇa</em></td>        <td>Grammar</td>    </tr><tr>        <td><em>manōdharmasaṅgīta</em></td>        <td>Improvised music</td>    </tr><tr>        <td><em>mēḷam</em></td>        <td>Musical scale</td>    </tr><tr>        <td><em>mēḷakartā</em></td>        <td><em>Mēḷam</em>-creator</td>    </tr><tr>        <td><em>prayōga</em></td>        <td>Musical phrase, comprising multiple <em>svara</em>s, and sung without pause</td>    </tr><tr>        <td><em>rāga</em></td>        <td>Melodic mode</td>    </tr><tr>        <td><em>rāgabhāva</em></td>        <td>The <em>bhāva</em>s associated with a <em>rāga</em></td>    </tr><tr>        <td><em>rāgalakṣaṇa</em></td>        <td>The <em>lakṣaṇa</em> associated with a <em>rāga</em></td>    </tr><tr>        <td><em>rasika</em></td>        <td>Connoisseur</td>    </tr><tr>        <td><em>sampūrna</em></td>        <td>Complete</td>    </tr><tr>        <td><em>saṅgati</em></td>        <td><em>Prayōga</em>, associated with a song</td>    </tr><tr>        <td><em>saptasvara</em></td>        <td>The 7 <em>svara</em>s in an octave</td>    </tr><tr>        <td><em>ṣadja</em></td>        <td>The base <em>svara</em> of an octave</td>    </tr><tr>        <td><em>svara</em></td>        <td>Ornamented note</td>    </tr><tr>        <td><em>svarasthāna</em></td>        <td>Note</td>    </tr></tbody></table><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><h3>References:</h3><ol><li><a href="http://sanjaysub.libsyn.com/the-sanjay-subrahmanyan-show-episode-11-chat-with-dr-n-ramanathan-and-sriram-v">Episode 11 of the Sanjay Subrahmanyan show, with Sriram V and Dr. N Ramanathan</a></li><li><a href="http://www.carnatica.net/newsletter/index.html">Carnatica Archival Centre's Music Appreciation newsletters</a></li><li><a href="http://karnatik.com/">karnatik.com</a></li></ol></div>
