### The *mēḷakartā* scheme

Carnatic music is defined by its usage of *rāga*s. Each *rāga* can invoke specific emotions in *rasika*s, and each *rasika* will have their set of favourite (and disliked) *rāga*s. Both the *kalpitasaṅgīta* and *manōdharmasaṅgīta* aspects of music adhere to the underlying *rāgalakṣaṇa*, or the grammar of the *rāga*. With few exceptions, each piece is composed in one prescribed *rāga*, and that *rāga* constrains the music in that piece. Transgressing the boundaries of a *rāga* by mistake is an egregious error, and such an *apasvara* would be spotted immediately by many *rasika*s.

Much music theory is devoted to classifying these *rāga*s. The predominant scheme used to today is the *mēḷakartā* scheme, involving 72 *mēḷakartā*, or *janakarāga*s, and all other *janyarāga*s classified “under” them. Ramamatya (*circa* 1550 CE), in his *svaramēḷakalānidhi*, proposed a *mēḷa*‐based scheme, which Venkatamakhin (17th c. CE) extended into a *mēḷakartā* scheme in his *chaturdaṇḍiprakāśikā*. The scheme followed today is a standardised variant proposed by Govindacharya (17th–18th c. CE), in his *saṅgrahacūḍāmaṇi*.

### How it works

Twelve *svarasthāna*s are enumerated, from the base *ṣadja* to the *ṣadja* of the next octave (left‐inclusive), and are given the following names, picked from an earlier nomenclature.

* Sa
* Ri<sub>1</sub>
* Ri<sub>2</sub> or Ga<sub>1</sub>
* Ri<sub>3</sub> or Ga<sub>2</sub>
* Ga<sub>3</sub>
* Ma<sub>1</sub>
* Ma<sub>2</sub>
* Pa
* Da<sub>1</sub>
* Da<sub>2</sub> or Ni<sub>1</sub>
* Da<sub>3</sub> or Ni<sub>2</sub>
* Ni<sub>3</sub>

The *mēḷakartā*s, then, are all the possible *rāga*s that include the Sa & the Pa, and have one each Ri, Ga, Ma, Da & Ni, with the natural restriction that the Ri chosen should be lower than the Ga, and likewise the Da and the Ni. There are 6 possible Ri‐Ga combinations (Ri<sub>1</sub>‐Ga<sub>1</sub>, Ri<sub>1</sub>‐Ga<sub>2</sub>, Ri<sub>1</sub>‐Ga<sub>3</sub>, Ri<sub>2</sub>‐Ga<sub>2</sub>, Ri<sub>2</sub>‐Ga<sub>3</sub> & Ri<sub>3</sub>‐Ga<sub>3</sub>), likewise 6 combinations of Da‐Ni, and 2 options for Ma. There are thus 72 *mēḷakartā*s, also termed *sampūrnarāga*s as each such *rāga* has all 7 notes.

Every other *rāga*, which does not adhere to the above *lakṣaṇa*, is then notated as a pair of scales of the above 12 notes – an *ārōhaṇa* and an *avarōhaṇa* – that define them. The *ārōhaṇa* is a scale that starts at a lower Sa and ends at the next Sa and is meant to be the set of all possible ascending sequences of notes valid in the *rāga*. Likewise, the *avarōhaṇa*, starting at a higher Sa and ending at the previous Sa is meant to include all possible valid descending note sequences. The *janyarāga* is then classified as a derivative the *mēḷakartā* rāga.

For instance,

* *Arabhi* is considered to be the scale Sa‐Ri<sub>2</sub>‐Ma<sub>1</sub>‐Pa‐Da<sub>2</sub>‐Sa; Sa‐Ni<sub>3</sub>‐Da<sub>2</sub>‐Pa‐Ma<sub>1</sub>‐Ga<sub>3</sub>‐Ri<sub>2</sub>‐Sa, and is thus classified under *mēḷakartā* Sa‐Ri<sub>2</sub>‐Ga<sub>3</sub>‐Ma<sub>1</sub>‐Pa‐Da<sub>2</sub>‐Ni<sub>3</sub>‐Sa; Sa‐Ni<sub>3</sub>‐Da<sub>2</sub>‐Pa‐Ma<sub>1</sub>‐Ga<sub>3</sub>‐Ri<sub>2</sub>‐Sa, which happens to be *Sankarabharanam*.
* *Purvikalyani*, which is assigned the scale Sa‐Ri<sub>1</sub>‐Ga<sub>3</sub>‐Ma<sub>2</sub>‐Pa‐Da<sub>2</sub>‐Pa‐Sa; Sa‐Ni<sub>3</sub>‐Da<sub>2</sub>‐Pa‐Ma<sub>2</sub>‐Ga<sub>3</sub>‐Ri<sub>1</sub>‐Sa, is considered a derivative of *mēḷakartā* Sa‐Ri<sub>1</sub>‐Ga<sub>3</sub>‐Ma<sub>2</sub>Pa‐Da<sub>2</sub>‐Ni<sub>3</sub>‐Sa; Sa‐Ni<sub>3</sub>‐Da<sub>2</sub>‐Pa‐Ma<sub>2</sub>‐Ga<sub>3</sub>‐Ri<sub>1</sub>‐Sa or *Gamanasramam*.
* *Bhairavi*, nominally the scale Sa‐Ga<sub>2</sub>‐Ri<sub>2</sub>‐Ga<sub>2</sub>‐Ma<sub>1</sub>‐Pa‐Da<sub>2</sub>‐Ni<sub>3</sub>‐Sa; Sa‐Ni<sub>3</sub>‐Da<sub>1</sub>‐Pa‐Ma<sub>1</sub>‐Ga<sub>2</sub>‐Ri<sub>2</sub>‐Sa (note the 2 different Gas), is classified under Sa‐Ri<sub>2</sub>‐Ga<sub>2</sub>‐Ma<sub>1</sub>‐Pa‐Da<sub>1</sub>‐Ni<sub>3</sub>‐Sa; Sa‐Ni<sub>3</sub>‐Da<sub>1</sub>‐Pa‐Ma<sub>1</sub>‐Ga<sub>2</sub>‐Ri<sub>2</sub>‐Sa, *Natabhairavi*, with the Da<sub>2</sub> considered an *anyasvara*.

### Usage

In pedagogy and in musicology, a *rāga* is introduced as a child of a *mēḷakartā* and then in terms of its *ārōhaṇa* and *avarōhaṇa*. An excerpt from a songʼs [lyric page](http://www.karnatik.com/c2577.shtml) follows:

    raagam: bEgaDa
    29 dheera shankaraabharaNam janya
    Aa: S G3 R2 G3 M1 P D2 N2 D2 P S
    Av: S N3 D2 P M1 G3 R2 S

*Rasika*s in the know seek to learn which *mēḷakartā* a *rāga* belongs to, and attempt to understand the *rāga* based on this scheme.

Unfortunately, this entire exercise is pointless.

### Disconnect between definition and notation

Inherently, what defines a *rāga* is not the set of notes but the phrases. The notes used to describe the phrases, let alone the *ārōhaṇa*/*avarōhaṇa*, are but notational conveniences. Notice for instance, that *Atana* is notated with a Ga, but the Ga sung in *Atana* is an oscillation between Ri<sub>2</sub> and Ma<sub>1</sub>. Likewise in *Darbar*, where the Ga a different oscillation, also between Ri<sub>2</sub> and Ma<sub>1</sub>. A Pa‐Da<sub>2</sub>‐Sa phrase from *Suddhasaveri* and one from *Yadukulakambhoji* are identical to a Pa‐Ni<sub>2</sub>‐Sa phrase from *Madhyamavati* and one from *Dhanyasi*. And a classic phrase from *Anandabhairavi* can be annotated as both Pa‐Da<sub>2</sub>‐Pa‐Sa or Pa‐Ni<sub>2</sub>‐Pa‐Sa!

The result is a disconnect between *rāgalakṣaṇa* and their notation, leading to a huge disconnect between many classic *janyarāga*s and their nominal parents. None of *Sahana*, *Khamas*, *Kambhoji*, *Natakurinji*, *Suratti* and *Mohanam* have anything to do with any other, but for the fact that they are classified under *Harikambhoji*. Likewise, *Reetigaula*, *Bhairavi*, *Darbarikanada*, *Hindolam*, *Suddhadhanyasi* are all classified under *Natabhairavi*, albeit none of them sound like any other. So what use is such a system that emphasises the names of the notes?

To quote musicologist Dr. N Ramanathan,

> People exclaim (the song) *Gajavadana*, set in *Todi*, has so many different kinds of Gas; thatʼs not the case. How remarkable that various different phrases are all termed Ga! We use a single symbol Ga to identify many of the phrases. That, I feel, is a very sophisticated scheme which in the 1800s or 1700s we (Carnatic music practitioners) have developed. The word *svara* itself has been redefined. *Svara* is no longer associated with a pitch – *svara* is a phrase. We say that *Sankarabharanam* has 4 kinds of Mas; *Begada* has 3 kinds of Mas. No, we term all those phrases Ma.

Any system that emphasises notational conveniences at the expense of the *lakṣaṇa* of the *rāga* is missing the point.

### Inapplicability to many *rāga*s

*Rāga*s inherently are not a taxonomy, and trying to fit them into a hierarchical structure is futile. There are undoubtedly relationships among some *rāga*s: *Mukhari*, *Bhairavi*, *Huseni* and *Manji* have some common phrases. But while as above *Bhairavi* is classified under *Natabhairavi*, people think *Huseni* sounds somewhat like *Anandabhairavi*, which is classified under *Kharaharapriya*. Our taxon is very unwieldy.

The *janyarāga* examples above – *Arabhi*, *Purvikalyani*, *Bhairavi* – happen to contain all the *saptasvara*s. What if the *rāga* does not? There would be multiple *mēḷakartā* super‐sets of this *rāga*, so which one do you pick as parent? There are 2 systems in usage:

* Pick the earlier one: if the *janyarāga* does not contain say, Ri, then pick the *mēḷakartā* with Ri<sub>1</sub> rather than Ri<sub>2</sub> or Ri<sub>3</sub>. This arbitrary choice only helps derail the already tenuous *janaka*‐*janya* relationship.
* Pick the *mēḷakartā* that sounds “closest”. This choice is also arbitrary, as many *janyarāga*s donʼt sound like any of the candidate parent *mēḷakartā* *rāga*s. *Madhyamavati* can be assigned to *Natabhairavi*, *Kharaharapriya*, *Charukesi* or *Harikambhoji* on this basis, but sounds like none of them.

Many *rāga*s, not amenable to being described as a linear progession of notes, are strait‐jacketed as they are fit into an *ārōhaṇa*/*avarōhaṇa* scheme. *Atana*, *Suratti*, *Sindhubhairavi*, *Purvikalyani*, *Bhairavi*, *Kambhoji* all include phrases that cannot be fit into a linear scale. *Atana* and *Suratti* are especially problematic: no *ārōhaṇa*/*avarōhaṇa* written for them cover even a portion of the phrases possible. Finding a *mēḷakartā* parent is futile.

Lastly, *bhāṣāṅgarāga*s exhibit different problems of classification, as its sometimes unclear which *svara*s belong in the scale and which are *anyasvara*s. *Kapi*, *Sindhubhairavi* and *Brindavani* exemplify this problem.

### Harm

Generations of students has grown up focussing on learning the wrong bases of *rāga*s, the foundation of Carnatic music. Generations of *rasika*s has been cheated out of appreciating the grain of *rāgabhāva*, by concentrating on the chaff of *mēḷakartā*s. A chance of a deeper understanding of Carnatic classical music has been lost on account of trying to marry Indian music ideas to European music concepts of pitches, notes and scales.

### The path forward

Pedagogy must focus on learning *rāgabhāva* through *saṅgati*s and *lakṣaṇa* without focussing on *ārōhaṇa*/*avarōhaṇa*. And *rasika*s should be steered clear of trying to enjoy a *rāga* through learning scales.
