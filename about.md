I am Ambarish. I live in the Puget Sound area and work for a large software company. This website is about [Dravidian languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dravidian_languages), [Sanskrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit), [Srivaishnavism](https://ramanuja.org/sv.html), [Carnatic music](https://www.rasikas.org/forums/), and mathematics.
